- Keep staking requests as non-custodial, pending records with no automatic payout or fabricated wallet balance; this app does not integrate a payment rail.
- Grant owner access only after server-validated identity and a matching verified owner email; client state is never an authority for admin actions.
- Read public package and settings data with RLS and run account-specific operations with authenticated server functions; this separates public browsing from private records.
